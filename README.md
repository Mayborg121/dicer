# Dice Rolling Game ðŸŽ²

This is a simple, web-based dice rolling game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to roll a virtual dice, displaying random outcomes each time the dice is "rolled." The project was created while learning JavaScript and exploring DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features

- Random dice rolls generating numbers between 1 and 6
- Dynamic and interactive UI using JavaScript
- Minimalistic design with CSS for a clean user interface
- Easy to expand for future development (e.g., adding more players, scoring system)

## How It Works

1. Click the "Roll" button to roll the dice.
2. The game generates a random number between 1 and 6.
3. The corresponding dice face is displayed on the screen.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage
- **CSS**: Styling for the page elements
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for dice rolling and DOM manipulation

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dice-rolling-game.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start playing the game.
